## Algo-Mapper

### Summary

While learning new algorithms, it is very common for users to get lost tracking variables, miss a conceptual step, and have trouble visualizing all the math into a physical model. So we built a full-stack web app that will allow users to walkthrough step-by-step through an algorithm and be able to compare the time-complexity of different algorithms.

### Technologies

##### _Algorithm visualizations_

Due to the nature of algorithms having very different logic, a very modular and

##### _Graphs_

With this website, users will be able to:

- [ ] Pick and choose between 4 different algorithms that find shortest path,
- [ ] View a show page with algorithm visualization, details, and code,
- [ ] Comparison page that allows user to pick between two algorithms, see each of their visualizations, and differences in time complexity,
- [ ] Create example shortest path model that can be used for each algorithm,
- [ ] Can pause visualization and take it step-by-step.

__Bonus MVP__:

- [ ] Compare between different programming languages
- [ ] Compare space complexity if method is found
- [ ] Add additional algorithms
