# Flex Project!

PLAN:

### MVPs

 - 5-6 Different Algorithms
 - Algorithm visualization
 - Testing Parameters
 - Work only in a single language

 - ** Bonus: Maybe different types of data structures as well? **
- ** Bonus: Different languages! **

### Technologies

- Python/Django/MongoDB Backend
- React/Redux/D3 Frontend

### Testing parameters:

- Time and Space complexity
- Worst case performance
- Worst case space complexity

- __**Not all Algorithms can be used with all data structures__

## Front End Tasks

- Create visualization
- Create tests
- Wireframes

#### Algorithms

- Deciding on which algos and what data structures

### Weekend Work

- Algorithmssssss
- Learn a lot of shit
  - Get backend working
  - Algorithm selection
  - Data type selection
