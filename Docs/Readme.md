# Flex Project!

PLAN:

### MVPs

 - 5-6 Different Algorithms
  - A*
  - Dijkstra's
  - Bellman-Ford
  - Gabow's Algorithm
  - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
  - Johnson's Algorithm
 - Algorithm visualization
 - Testing Parameters
 - Work only in a single language

 - _Bonus: Maybe different types of data structures as well?_
 - _Bonus: Different languages!_

### Technologies

- Python/Django/MongoDB Backend
- React/Redux/D3 Frontend

### Testing parameters:

- Time and Space complexity
- Worst case performance
- Worst case space complexity

- __Not all Algorithms can be used with all data structures__

## Back End Tasks

- Python and Django
- MongoDB setup
- Bonus: _User interaction, clickable nodes?_

## Front End Tasks

- Create visualization
- Create tests
- Wireframes

#### Algorithms

- Deciding on which algos and what data structures

### Weekend Work

- Algorithmssssss
- Learn a lot of shit
  - Get backend working
  - Algorithm selection
  - Data type selection

### Weekend Goals!
